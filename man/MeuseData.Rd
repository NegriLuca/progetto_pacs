\description{
This data set gives locations, top soil heavy metal concentrations (ppm) and other variables, collected in a flood plain of the river Meuse. 
For details on this dataset, see \code{meuse.all} in \url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gstat/gstat.pdf}. This version of the dataset
includes 155 observations. Moreover, a definition of the domain's boundary is provided through the file {\link{MeuseBorder}}, 
as it is used in many examples to illustrate fdaPDE features. 
\itemize{
  \item sample: original sample number. In this version of the dataset some observations has been left out because not indicative, or outliers.
  \item x: numeric vector indicating the x-coordinate (m) in RDM (Dutch topographical map coordinates).
  \item y: numeric vector indicating the y-coordinate (m) in RDM (Dutch topographical map coordinates).
  \item cadmium: topsoil cadmium concentration (ppm).
  \item copper: topsoil copper concentration (ppm).
  \item lead: topsoil lead concentration (ppm).
  \item zinc: topsoil zinc concentration (ppm).
  \item elev: relative elevation.
  \item dist.log(m): logarithm of the distance to river Meuse (metres), as obtained during the field survey.
  \item om: organic matter, as percentage.
  \item ffreq: flooding frequency class.
  \item soil: soil type.
